Project Title: Scalable and Secure AWS Cloud Infrastructure for Web Applications

Objective: Designed, implemented, and managed a scalable, secure, and highly available cloud infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) to support web applications.

Key Responsibilities:

Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Utilized AWS CloudFormation and Terraform to define and provision the infrastructure, ensuring repeatability and consistency.
Compute Services: Deployed EC2 instances for application hosting, optimized instance types for cost efficiency and performance, and utilized Auto Scaling Groups for automatic scaling based on load.
Storage Solutions: Implemented Amazon S3 for static content storage, leveraging lifecycle policies for cost management. Used EBS volumes for persistent storage needs.
Networking: Configured VPCs, subnets, route tables, and security groups to ensure secure and isolated network architecture. Implemented NAT gateways and VPN connections for secure access.
Load Balancing and DNS: Configured Elastic Load Balancers (ELB) to distribute traffic across multiple instances, ensuring high availability. Managed DNS records using Route 53 for reliable and scalable domain name management.
Database Management: Set up RDS instances with read replicas for relational database needs, and DynamoDB for NoSQL requirements, ensuring high performance and scalability.
Monitoring and Logging: Deployed CloudWatch for monitoring system performance and setting up alarms for critical metrics. Integrated CloudTrail and AWS Config for logging and auditing.
Security and Compliance: Implemented IAM roles and policies to enforce the principle of least privilege. Used AWS KMS for encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
Disaster Recovery and Backup: Designed and tested disaster recovery strategies, including regular backups using AWS Backup and cross-region replication for critical data.
Cost Management: Monitored and optimized AWS usage using AWS Cost Explorer and Trusted Advisor to ensure cost-effective resource utilization.
Technologies Used: AWS EC2, S3, VPC, Route 53, RDS, DynamoDB, CloudFormation, Terraform, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, IAM, ELB, Auto Scaling Groups, AWS Backup, AWS Config, AWS KMS.
