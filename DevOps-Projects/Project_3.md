Project_3 Title: Dockerized Development Environment for MySQL, Java, and Python

Objective: Developed a Docker-based solution to streamline the setup and deployment of development environments for MySQL, Java, and Python applications.

Key Responsibilities:

Docker Configuration: Created Dockerfiles to define custom images for MySQL, Java, and Python, ensuring a consistent and isolated development environment.
Multi-Container Application: Utilized Docker Compose to define and manage a multi-container application, orchestrating containers for MySQL, Java, and Python.
Environment Setup: Automated the installation and configuration of MySQL, Java, and Python within their respective containers, ensuring they are correctly set up with necessary dependencies and configurations.
MySQL: Configured a MySQL container with a custom initialization script to set up databases, users, and permissions.
Java: Created a Dockerfile for a Java container, installing the required JDK and setting up the environment for running Java applications.
Python: Built a Dockerfile for a Python container, installing necessary libraries and frameworks using pip, and configuring the environment for Python development.
Volume Management: Implemented Docker volumes to persist data and ensure that database data, application logs, and other critical files are not lost when containers are stopped or recreated.
Networking: Configured Docker networks to enable seamless communication between containers, ensuring that the application components can interact securely and efficiently.
Automation and Scripting: Developed shell scripts to automate the build and deployment process, simplifying the setup for new developers and continuous integration pipelines.
Documentation: Created comprehensive documentation detailing the setup, configuration, and usage of the Dockerized environment, including instructions for building and running containers, and troubleshooting common issues.
Security and Best Practices: Ensured best practices for container security, such as minimizing image size, running containers with non-root users, and keeping dependencies up-to-date.
Technologies Used: Docker, Docker Compose, MySQL, Java, Python, Shell Scripting, Linux.

This project description highlights your ability to use Docker for setting up and managing development environments, showcasing skills in containerization, automation, and multi-container orchestration, which are valuable to potentialÂ employers.
