Project_4 Title: AWS Cloud Infrastructure Management with CLI and Linux Commands

Cloud Infrastructure Management: Utilized AWS CLI and Linux commands to provision, configure, and manage AWS resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, RDS databases, and VPCs.
Instance Management: Automated the provisioning and configuration of EC2 instances using shell scripts, ensuring consistent and repeatable setup processes.
Storage Solutions: Managed S3 buckets for data storage and backup, including setting up lifecycle policies, and configuring access controls using Linux commands and AWS CLI.
Configuration Management: Implemented configuration management tools like Ansible and used Linux commands to deploy and manage configurations across multiple servers.
Ansible Playbooks: Wrote Ansible playbooks for automated configuration and management of server environments, leveraging Linux commands for task execution.
Deployment Automation: Developed scripts to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for applications using Linux commands and tools like Jenkins and Git.
CI/CD Pipelines: Set up and maintained CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, using shell scripting to automate tasks such as code compilation, testing, and deployment.
Version Control: Integrated Git for source code management, using Linux commands to handle branching, merging, and versioning.
Monitoring and Logging: Implemented monitoring solutions using CloudWatch and custom scripts to collect and analyze logs and metrics, ensuring system health and performance.
Log Management: Configured centralized logging solutions using Linux commands to aggregate and analyze logs from various sources.
Performance Monitoring: Automated the collection of performance metrics and set up alerts for critical thresholds using CloudWatch and Linux scripts.
Security and Compliance: Enforced security best practices and compliance policies using Linux commands and AWS IAM to manage user permissions and access controls.
IAM Policies: Automated the creation and management of IAM roles and policies using AWS CLI and Linux scripts to enforce the principle of least privilege.
Data Encryption: Configured encryption for data at rest and in transit using Linux commands and AWS KMS.
Backup and Recovery: Developed and implemented backup and recovery strategies using Linux commands to ensure data integrity and availability.
Automated Backups: Scheduled automated backups for critical data using cron jobs and Linux scripts.
Disaster Recovery: Created and tested disaster recovery plans, ensuring quick recovery and minimal downtime.
Technologies Used: Linux, AWS CLI, EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, Ansible, Jenkins, Git, CloudWatch, IAM, KMS, Shell Scripting.
